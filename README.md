# Quick Start Guide

This branch includes the code for adding Locomotive Scroll to the GSAP ScrollTrigger animation that we created in the **Main** branch in order to provide a smooth scrolling experience. An effect similar to what you can see in my portfolio website at https://akbarbakhshi.com/about. Below is the link to the Youtube video for the original scrolling effect:

Download or clone the project on your local drive. Open Terminal (Command prompt) and navigate to the project folder. Then run ```npm install```. You should see a new folder called **node_modules** in the project folder.

During **Development**, from the terminal, inside the project folder, run ``` npm start``` command to start the server. You should see a new folder called **public** in the project folder with compiled css, javascript and all the files in the static folder. You now can visit ***localhost:3000*** in your browser to access the home page.

For **Production**, make sure to run ``` npm frontend:prod``` command inside the project folder.
